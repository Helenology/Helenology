### Hello World 👋

- 🤍 I am currently a Stat Ph.D. at Peking University. 
- 🏔️ My research interests focused on using appropriate statistical methodology to answer real application questions (or applied statistics). This includes but is not limited to:
	- Weakly supervised learning;
	- Labeling, including _mislabeling_ and _crowdsourcing_;
	- Medical imaging anaylsis;
	- Nonparametrics, including _kernel density estimation_.
 - 📫 How to reach me **helenology@163.com**
- 🎀 Coding languages: `python` and `R`; can read a little `C`, `C++`, and `Matlab`.
  - 🏓 Everyday I just write bugs and then fix them.
